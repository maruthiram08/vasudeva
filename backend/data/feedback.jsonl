It is essential to recognize that anger, like all emotions, is transient, and holding onto it only binds you further to the cycle of suffering. To let go, reflect on the nature of attachments and realize that forgiveness is a gift you give yourself, freeing you from past burdens. \n\nPractice seeing the divine in every soul, even those who have wronged you. Cultivating compassion and understanding for their actions can help you release the hold of anger. Remember, the ultimate aim of life is devotion to the Lord and purity of heart; thus, let your focus be on love and kindness, which will illuminate your path to peace.", "story_title": "Prahlada's Forgiveness for His Father", "story_character": "Prahlada", "story_source": "Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 7, Chapter 10", "vote": "downvote", "downvote_reason": "guidance_generic", "detailed_feedback": "", "response_time_ms": null}
